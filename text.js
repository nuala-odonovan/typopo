  'Thank you loving me for who I am. Thanks for making me laugh and smile when i’m sad or have a bad day. I still get excited when I see your name pop up on my phone. You’re always on my mind. You’re all I want, all I need. You’re my whole entire world. Babe, you know I love you and I tell you everyday to remind you, but you’ll never know how much I love you because my love for you can’t be expressed in words. I know I’m not the best, but I’ll always be here for you if you let me. How I wish that I could spend my whole life under the skies watching the stars with you? You’re the first and last person I want in my life. No amount of distance, pain, fights or differences in opinion can break our bond. We’re like the best of friends and the deepest of lovers. You are on my mind every second, every minute, every hour, every day and every single time I blink. You fill all the space in my mind and heart. I love you baby. When I am with you, it feels like a dream come true. You are my angel from heaven. I love you. I cannot find words to tell you how much I love you. You mean everything to me. Please stay by my side forever. I cannot possibly think of loving anyone else the way I love you. You are my life, I cannot imagine my life without you. Or relationship is like that of Tom and Jerry show. We tease each other, knock each other down, chase each other, irritate each other terribly but we can never live this life without one another. You mean so much to me. You filled my life with music, color and laughter. I can’t imagine a life without you or a life before you or a life after you. You fill my head with thoughts of you. you are in my heart and you fill my every being with just your existence. I will never ever be able to love anyone as much as I have love you. I have blindly followed you and trusted you and never could I trust another. You know my darkest secrets and my happiest moments you see me more often at my worst than at my best. You might not realize this but you and me just click. You are my strength and my weakness, my joy and my headache but I am so thankful And glad that every morning I wake up and think about you and every night I dream about you. I will always and forever love you even when words can not say it you will know this. You’re the cutest guy in the world. I love you so much babe. Every time I tell you I love you, I mean it like ten times harder than the last time. Cause my feelings for you multiple everyday. You make me fall for you everyday, over and over again. You make me so happy. Whenever I’m with you I can’t help but smile, and laugh. Or stare at you. (I do that a lot) I know we’ve been through a lot, with us breaking up and stuff like that. But it was all a test, to see if I really did like you. Cause if I didn’t we wouldn’t of been together right now, stronger than the 1st couple times. I just want you to know, no matter what we go through I will just be a call, text, chat, message away. I’ll always be here for you. Always. I hope we are always together. And this ain’t that 2 week “i’m in love” bullshit. It’s the actual feeling. And it’s fucking amazing. I want to be the reason you look at your phone and smile. I love the way you make me happy, and the ways you show your care. I love the way you say, ‘I Love You’, and the way you’re always there. Another month, another year, another smile, another tear, another winter, another summer too, never want to spend any of them without you. I want you to know how much I appreciate all of the things you do for me. you make me feel needed, wanted, and cared about. You are absolutely amazing. the most amazing person I have ever met. You always make sure i’m smiling, laughing, and having a good time. When I am in your arms i feel so safe and it makes me think I am the luckiest girl in the world to have such an amazing boyfriend. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. You have the most caring heart. For once in my life I feel beautiful and wanted. It is unbelievable how I can be myself around you and feel so close to you, I feel like I have known you forever! I couldn’t imagine my life without you. I may not be the nicest or the best girlfriend sometimes, and I promise you that I will treat you how you deserve to be treated from now on. When your not around you are ALL i think about! I’ve never felt this way about anyone in my life. I’ve never had second thoughts or regrets about us. With all the tears and trouble we’ve been through its worth it because I got to share my heart with you! You’ve opened my eyes to love and true happiness! I’ve never been so certain of anything in my life like I am us! Baby, i’m glad that you came into my life. I love you! I just love everything about you, your magical eyes, the sound of your voice and your gentle touch! I cant stop thinking about you when were apart! you mean the world to me, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you.'
